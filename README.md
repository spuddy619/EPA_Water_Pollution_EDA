Exploring data from the US Environmental Protection Agency concerning water pollution by state

# Purpose and Background:
- Explore state statistics on water pollution provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency via their Water Pollutant Loading Tool.
- The tool calculates and reports facility pollutant in pounds per year or by monitoring period based on NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permit limit and DMR (Discharge Monitoring Report) Data.
- What is National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)?
  - From the California Environmental Protection Agency: <br/>
  "The NPDES permit program (CWA Section 402) controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the United States. Point sources are discrete conveyances such as pipes or man-made ditches. Individual homes that are connected to a municipal system, use a septic system, or do not have a surface discharge do not need an NPDES permit; however, industrial, municipal, and other facilities must obtain permits if their discharges go directly to surface waters. US EPA has approved the Water Board's program to issue NPDES permits"
